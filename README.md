**BPer** is a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) command line tool that provides capabilities to *backport* [1] pull requests in an automated way. This tool also comes with a predefined GitHub action in order to make CI/CD integration easier for all users.

[1] *backporting* is an action aiming to move a change (usually a commit) from a branch (usually the main one) to another one, which is generally referring to a still maintained release branch. Keeping it simple: it is about to move a specific change or a set of them from one branch to another.

## Usage

This tool is released on the [public npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/), therefore it can be easily installed using `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install -g @lampajr/bper
```

Then it can be used as any other command line tool:

```bash
$ bper -tb <branch> -pr <pull-request-url> -a <github-token> [-f <your-folder>]
```

### Inputs

This toold comes with some inputs that allow users to override the default behavior, here the full list of available inputs:

| **Name**      | **Command**          | **Required** | **Description**                                                                                                                                        | **Default** |

| Pull Request  | -pr, --pull-request  | Y            | Original pull request url, the one that must be backported, e.g., https://github.com/lampajr/backporting/pull/1                                        |             |
| Auth          | -a, --auth           | N            | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) | ""          |

## GitHub Action

This action can be used in any GitHub workflow, below you can find a simple example of manually triggered workflow backporting a specific pull request (provided as input).

```yml
name: Pull Request Backporting using BPer

on: 
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      targetBranch:
        description: 'Target branch'
        required: true
        type: string
      pullRequest:
        description: 'Pull request'
        required: true 
        type: string
      dryRun:
        description: 'Dry run'
        required: false
        default: "true" 
        type: string

jobs:
  backporting:
    name: "Backporting"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Backporting
        uses: lampajr/backporting@main
        with:
          target-branch: ${{ inputs.targetBranch }}
          pull-request: ${{ inputs.pullRequest }}
          auth: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          dry-run: ${{ inputs.dryRun }}
```

You can also use this action with other events - you'll just need to specify `target-branch` and `pull-request` params.

For example, this configuration creates a pull request against branch `v1` once the current one is merged, provided that the label `backport-v1` is applied:

```yaml
name: Pull Request Backporting using BPer

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types:
      - closed
      - labeled

jobs:
  backporting:
    name: "Backporting"
    # Only react to merged PRs for security reasons.
    # See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target.
    if: >
      github.event.pull_request.merged
      && (
        github.event.action == 'closed'
          && contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'backport-v1')
        || (
          github.event.action == 'labeled'
          && contains(github.event.label.name, 'backport-v1')
        )
      )
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Backporting
        uses: lampajr/backporting@main
        with:
          target-branch: v1
          pull-request: ${{ github.event.pull_request.url }}
          auth: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

For a complete description of all inputs see [Inputs section](#inputs).

## Limitations

**BPer** is in development mode, this means that it has many limitations right now. I'll try to summarize the most importan ones:

- No way to override backporting pull request fields like body, reviewers and so on.
- You can backport pull requests only.
- It only works for [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- Integrated in GitHub Actions CI/CD only.

Based on these limitations, the next **Future Works** could be the following:
- Give users the possibility to override/customize the backporting pull request.
- Provide a way to backport single commit too (or a set of them), even if no original pull request is present.
- Integrate this tool with other git management services (like GitLab and Bitbucket) to make it as generic as possible.
- Provide some reusable GitHub workflows.

## Contributing

This is an open source project, and you are more than welcome to contribute :heart:!

Every change must be submitted through a GitHub pull request (PR). Backporting uses continuous integration (CI). The CI runs checks against your branch after you submit the PR to ensure that your PR doesnâ€™t introduce errors. If the CI identifies a potential problem, our friendly PR maintainers will help you resolve it.

> **Note**: this project follows [git-conventional-commits](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13) standards, thanks to the [commit-msg hook](./.husky/commit-msg) you are not allowed to use commits that do not follow those standards.

1. Fork it (https://github.com/lampajr/backporting).

2. Create your feature branch: (git checkout -b feature).

3. Commit your changes with a comment: (git commit -am 'Add some feature').

4. Push to the branch to GitHub: (git push origin feature).

5. Create a new pull request against `main` branch.

> **Note**: you don't need to take care about typescript compilation and minifycation, there are automated [git hooks](./.husky) taking care of that!
